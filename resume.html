    <p>
        I began working in the pastry business around fifteen years ago. I am creative and can make very detailed servings. My specialty is in cakes and bread. I have crafted several recipes that have received positive feedback. I am also very versatile and can incorporate ingredients that cater to specific <span class="three"><strong>allergies</strong></span> or <span class= "four"><strong>dislikes</strong></span>. I have practiced this for a while and have found recipes that are just as delicious as the ones with allergens.
