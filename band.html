        <h2>Legacy</h2>
    <p>
        Pussy Cat Dolls is one of the best female bands that have ever existed. They introduced a whole new style of music, dance, and fashion. The band was formed in the mid 90s and continued till the early 2010s. Luckily for us, they recently began performing and releasing <strong>new music!</strong>They are still very talented and have a lot of energy as performers.

 <h2><strong>About Them

 </strong></h2>
    <p>
        The lead singer of the band is Nicole Scherzinger. She is always the main character in the music videos and on-stage performances. The rest of te members are American. They are also very talented in the way they dance. I've never really heard them sing clearly but they seem like they also have wonderful voices.
